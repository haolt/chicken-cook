            | Plymouth Rock chickens are good all-rounders. They are a dual-purpose bird, meaning they lay a high number of eggs and produce tasty meat.
            br
            | They also make great backyard pets, particularly for families with children or people that have never owned chickens before.
          h5.article__subTitle Breed Varieties
          p.article__content
            | There are multiple varieties of Plymouth Rock chickens. The original and most common is the Barred Plymouth Rock (also known as the Barred Rock).
            br
            | The White Plymouth Rock is also common. All other varieties are rare. These include:

          p.article__content
            | Plymouth Rock chickens have a lovely temperament. They are friendly and calm.
            br
            | This makes them very easy to approach and to hold, especially if they have been handled by humans regularly from a young age.
            br
            | They get along well with other breeds of chicken and very rarely fight or cause issues. They are more likely to be bullied by more aggressive breeds.
          h6.article__subTitle2 Eggs
          p.article__content
            | Plymouth Rock hens are good egg layers. They lay around 280 eggs per year. Their eggs are large and light brown.
            br
            | They begin laying when they are between 16 and 22 weeks old. They lay best for the first few years and start declining egg production around 3 years old. Some hens have been known to continue to lay until they are 10!
            br
            | They lay consistently throughout the year, even when it is cold.
            br
            | Plymouth Rocks are not particularly broody but can be reliable sitters if they are allowed to keep their eggs.
